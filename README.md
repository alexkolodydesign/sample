Washington County Trail Web App

### Prerequisites

Node > 7.6 and npm are required. Multiple versions of node can be used with nvm (osx) or nvm-windows (windows).


### Installing

The tasks to run everything are found in package.json under "scripts". The main task used is "dev". This will start the web server and use webpack to watch any file changes using the "assets" task in package.json. The assets task then uses the webpack.config.js file to tell webpack how to compile the assets.

```
Run project in development.
> npm run dev
```


## Deployment

Coming when the correct servers are set up.
